### ✅ Project TODO Checklist

#### Phase 0: Project Setup & Configuration

- [x] Initialize a project using `create-t3-app`.
- [x] Install and configure libraries: `shadcn/ui`, `@ai-sdk`, and `lucide-react`.
- [x] Set up the initial Git repository, and create a `README.md` file with a project description and setup instructions.
- [x] Configure environment variables (`.env`) for the language model API key.

#### Phase 1: Architecture, Routing & Typing

- [x] Create the base application folder structure (e.g., `_components`, `_lib`, `_actions`).
- [x] Define core application types in TypeScript (e.g., `User`, `Message`, `ChatMessage`).
- [x] Implement the root layout (`layout.tsx`) and the layout for authorized users in the `(authorized)` route group.
- [x] Create placeholder pages for `/login`, `/chat`, and `/profile`.
- [x] Implement `loading.tsx`, `error.tsx`, and `not-found.tsx` files in key routing segments for better UX and error handling.
- [x] Build shared navigation components (e.g., `Sidebar`) and implement active menu state logic.

#### Phase 2: Mocked Authentication (with Server Actions)

- [x] Create the login form on the `/login` page using `shadcn/ui` components.
- [x] Implement `login` and `logout` logic.
- [x] Use **React Context** (`AuthContext` + `AuthProvider`) for client-side session state management (storing the logged-in user object).
- [x] Secure routes within the `(authorized)` group.

#### Phase 3: Core Chat Interface (Text Streaming)

- [x] Create an API Route Handler (`/api/chat/route.ts`) to handle communication with the Vercel AI SDK.
- [x] Build the chat interface components: `ChatArea`, `MessageList`, `MessageInput`.
- [x] Integrate the `useChat` hook from the `@ai-sdk` library to manage chat state, send messages, and handle response streaming.
- [x] Implement loading indicators while the AI is generating a response.
- [x] Style the interface and add auto-scrolling functionality to the latest message.
- [x] Chat area position should be fixed at the bottom of the screen.
- [x] Fix any potential type conversion errors between `UIMessage` and the AI SDK's `Message` during development.

#### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Files & Profile)

- [x] **Multimodal Chat:**
  - [x] Extend the `MessageInput` component to support file (image) selection and display its preview.
  - [x] Implement client-side logic for converting the image to Base64 format.
  - [x] Update the API Route Handler (`/api/chat`) to handle multimodal messages (text + image).
- [x] **Profile Management:**
  - [x] Build the UI for the `/profile` page with a form for editing user data.
  - [x] Implement persistence of profile data in `localStorage` so that changes are saved locally.
  - [x] Ensure that profile changes are reactively reflected in other parts of the UI (e.g., in the `Header`).

#### Phase 6: Refinements & Feature Expansion

- [x] **Enhanced File Support:**
  - [x] Implement PDF file support in the chat.
- [ ] **Improved User Experience (UX):**
  - [ ] Implement a better error display system (e.g., using toasts) for API communication errors.
  - [ ] Display a "Hello!" welcome message on the chat page when there are no messages.
  - [ ] Improve the loading spinner for a more polished and modern feel.
- [ ] **UI & Responsiveness:**
  - [x] Implement a collapsible sidebar with a toggle icon for better mobile and tablet support.
  - [ ] Polish the UI and add responsive design for better user experience on mobile devices.
  - [ ] toast notifications description text color should be consistent with the rest of the UI.
- [ ] **Expanded Profile Management:**
  - [ ] Add functionality to change the user's avatar and email address.
- [ ] **Code Refactoring & Optimization:**
  - [ ] Refactor components to better leverage React Server Components (RSC), minimizing client-side logic.
  - [ ] Identify and abstract shared logic into reusable components to adhere to the DRY principle.

#### Phase 7: Finalization & Submission

- [ ] Conduct a full code review for **SOLID, DRY, KISS** principles, and **accessibility (a11y)**.
- [ ] Add concise **JSDoc** comments to key components and functions.
- [ ] Perform manual testing of all functionalities across different browsers and screen sizes (RWD).
- [ ] Ensure the Git history is clean and follows the **Conventional Commits** convention.
- [ ] Add transitions and animations to the application.
- [ ] Submit the project bundle file.

#### Phase 8: Advanced UX & Chat Utilities

- [ ] **Chat Management:**
    - [ ] Implement a "Start New Chat" button to clear the current conversation.
- [ ] **Message Interaction & Formatting:**
    - [ ] Add a "Copy" button to each message bubble for easy content copying.
    - [ ] Implement syntax highlighting for code blocks within AI responses.
    - [ ] Create a response navigation map/button to allow jumping between AI-generated answers in long conversations.
- [ ] **Error Handling:**
    - [ ] Enhance the root error boundary (`error.tsx`) to provide a "Refresh Page" option on application crash.

#### Optional Features

- [ ] **[Optional] Speech-to-Text:** Implement message dictation functionality using the Web Speech API.
