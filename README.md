# Magpie Chat App

---

### âœ… Project TODO Checklist

#### Phase 0: Project Setup & Configuration
-   [X] Initialize a project using `create-t3-app`.
-   [X] Install and configure libraries: `shadcn/ui`, `@ai-sdk`, and `lucide-react`.
-   [ ] Set up the initial Git repository, and create a `README.md` file with a project description and setup instructions.
-   [ ] Configure environment variables (`.env.local`) for the language model API key.

#### Phase 1: Architecture, Routing & Typing
-   [ ] Create the base application folder structure (e.g., `_components`, `_lib`, `_actions`).
-   [ ] Define core application types in TypeScript (e.g., `User`, `Message`, `ChatMessage`).
-   [ ] Implement the root layout (`layout.tsx`) and the layout for authorized users in the `(authorized)` route group.
-   [ ] Create placeholder pages for `/login`, `/chat`, and `/profile`.
-   [ ] Implement `loading.tsx`, `error.tsx`, and `not-found.tsx` files in key routing segments for better UX and error handling.
-   [ ] Build shared navigation components (e.g., `Sidebar`, `Header`) and implement active menu state logic.

#### Phase 2: Mocked Authentication (with Server Actions)
-   [ ] Create the login form on the `/login` page using `shadcn/ui` components.
-   [ ] Implement `login` and `logout` logic.
-   [ ] Use **React Context** (`AuthContext` + `AuthProvider`) for client-side session state management (storing the logged-in user object).
-   [ ] Secure routes within the `(authorized)` group.

#### Phase 3: Core Chat Interface (Text Streaming)
-   [ ] Create an API Route Handler (`/api/chat/route.ts`) to handle communication with the Vercel AI SDK.
-   [ ] Build the chat interface components: `ChatArea`, `MessageList`, `MessageInput`.
-   [ ] Integrate the `useChat` hook from the `@ai-sdk` library to manage chat state, send messages, and handle response streaming.
-   [ ] Implement loading indicators while the AI is generating a response.
-   [ ] Style the interface and add auto-scrolling functionality to the latest message.
-   [ ] Fix any potential type conversion errors between `UIMessage` and the AI SDK's `Message` during development.

#### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Files & Profile)
-   [ ] **Multimodal Chat:**
    -   [ ] Extend the `MessageInput` component to support file (image) selection and display its preview.
    -   [ ] Implement client-side logic for converting the image to Base64 format.
    -   [ ] Update the API Route Handler (`/api/chat`) to handle multimodal messages (text + image).
-   [ ] **Profile Management:**
    -   [ ] Build the UI for the `/profile` page with a form for editing user data.
    -   [ ] Use a Server Action to handle saving profile changes.
    -   [ ] Implement persistence of profile data in `localStorage` so that changes are saved locally.
    -   [ ] Ensure that profile changes are reactively reflected in other parts of the UI (e.g., in the `Header`).

#### Phase 5: Optional Features
-   [ ] **[Optional] Speech-to-Text:** Implement message dictation functionality using the Web Speech API.

#### Phase 6: Finalization & Submission
-   [ ] Conduct a full code review for **SOLID, DRY, KISS** principles, and **accessibility (a11y)**.
-   [ ] Add concise **JSDoc** comments to key components and functions.
-   [ ] Perform manual testing of all functionalities across different browsers and screen sizes (RWD).
-   [ ] Ensure the Git history is clean and follows the **Conventional Commits** convention.
